🎮 Tic Tac Toe (Python)

A simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in Python.
This project was built as a beginner-friendly exercise to practice Python fundamentals, control flow, and game logic.


✨ Features

Two-player game (X vs O)
2. Turn-based gameplay
3. Input validation (prevents invalid or duplicate moves)
4 Automatic win detection:
  - Rows
  - Columns
  - Diagonals
5. Draw (tie) detection
6. Clean and readable board display in the terminal


✒️ What I Learned

- Working with lists and indexing
- Writing reusable functions
- Handling user input safely
- Using loops and conditional logic
- Managing game state (win, draw, ongoing)
- Debugging logic and index-related errors


▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3 recommended)
2. Clone the repository or download the file
3. Run the script from the terminal:

```bash

python tic\_tac\_toe.py
